Should an author be able to submit anonymously (i.e. without storing any information about themselves on the servers)?  

What kind of encryption should be used for the uploaded files?  

What kind of power should the administrator have (delete submissions, give decryption permissions to users, etc)?  

Do the author's have to give permission to a user to decrypt their uploads?
