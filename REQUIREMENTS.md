Should an author be able to submit anonymously (i.e. without storing any information about themselves on the servers)?  

What kind of encryption should be used for the uploaded files?  

What kind of power should the administrator have (delete submissions, give decryption permissions to users, etc)?  

Do the author's have to give permission to a user to decrypt their uploads?

What happens to a user's bulletins if they delete their account?

What kind of information should be displayed publicly about an encrypted bulletin?

If a user is given permission to view an encrypted bulletin, an then that bulletin is edited, should additional permission be required to view the new information?

Should users be able to search for posts by a certain author, or would this feature pose too great a risk for the author's confidentiality - maybe add this as a feature authors can opt into.

On a similar note, should authors be able to be identified by a username?  Again, this may compromising to confidentiality, but could help authors develop a reputation and following
